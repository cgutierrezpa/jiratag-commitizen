Customizing commitizen is not hard at all.

The basic steps are:

1. Inheriting from `BaseCommitizen`
2. Give a name to your rules.
3. expose the class at the end of your file assigning it to `discover_this`
4. Create a python package starting with `cz_` using `setup.py`, `poetry`, etc


Check an [example](convcomms) on how to configure `BaseCommitizen`.

## Custom commit rules

Create a file starting with `cz_` for example `cz_jira.py`. This prefix
is used to detect the plugin. Same method [flask uses]

Inherit from `BaseCommitizen` and you must define `questions` and
`message`. The others are optionals.

```python
from commitizen.cz.base import BaseCommitizen

class JiraCz(BaseCommitizen):

    def questions(self) -> list:
        """Questions regarding the commit message."""
        questions = [
            {
                'type': 'input',
                'name': 'title',
                'message': 'Commit title'
            },
            {
                'type': 'input',
                'name': 'issue',
                'message': 'Jira Issue number:'
            },
        ]
        return questions

    def message(self, answers: dict) -> str:
        """Generate the message with the given answers."""
        return '{0} (#{1})'.format(answers['title'], answers['issue'])

    def example(self) -> str:
        """Provide an example to help understand the style (OPTIONAL)

        Used by `cz example`.
        """
        return 'Problem with user (#321)'

    def schema(self) -> str:
        """Show the schema used (OPTIONAL)

        Used by `cz schema`.
        """
        return '<title> (<issue>)'

    def info(self) -> str:
        """Explanation of the commit rules. (OPTIONAL)

        Used by `cz info`.
        """
        return 'We use this because is useful'


discover_this = JiraCz  # used by the plugin system
```

The next file required is `setup.py` modified from flask version

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name='JiraCommitizen',
    version='0.1.1',
    py_modules=['cz_jira'],
    license='MIT',
    long_description='this is a long description',
    install_requires=['commitizen']
)
```

So at the end we would have

    .
    ├── cz_jira.py
    └── setup.py

And that's it, you can install it without uploading to pypi by simply
doing `pip install .`

If you feel like it should be part of this repo, create a PR.

## Custom bump rules

You need to define 2 parameters inside `BaseCommitizen`.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `bump_pattern` | `str` | `None` | Regex to extract information from commit (subject and body) |
| `bump_map` | `dict` | `None` | Dictionary mapping the extracted information to a `SemVer` increment type (`MAJOR`, `MINOR`, `PATCH`) |

Let's see an exampple

```python
from commitizen.cz.base import BaseCommitizen


class StrangeCommitizen(BaseCommitizen):
    bump_pattern = r"^(break|new|fix|hotfix)"
    bump_map = {"break": "MAJOR", "new": "MINOR", "fix": "PATCH", "hotfix": "PATCH"}
```

That's it, your commitizen now supports custom rules and you can run

```bash
cz -n cz_strange bump
```
